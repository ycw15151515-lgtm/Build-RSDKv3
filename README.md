# RSDKv3 iOS

An iOS port of the RSDKv3 decompilation engine (Sonic CD). This is an **unsigned IPA** — you will need to sign it using AltStore, SideStore, TrollStore, or a similar sideloading tool.

Based on [RSDKModding/RSDKv3-Decompilation](https://github.com/RSDKModding/RSDKv3-Decompilation).

## Features
- Native ARM64 build optimized for iOS 13.0+
- Full touchscreen controls
- Landscape orientation support (iPhone & iPad)
- File sharing enabled — manage game files directly from the iOS Files app
- No copyrighted game assets included

## Installation

### Pre-built IPA
1. Download the latest IPA from [Releases](../../releases).
2. Install using **AltStore**, **SideStore**, **TrollStore**, or your preferred sideloading method.
3. Launch the app once — it will create its Documents folder.
4. Open the **Files** app → **On My iPhone** → **RSDKv3**.
5. Copy your own `Data.rsdk` file into this folder.
6. Optionally add a `videos/` folder with `.ogv` video files (Steam version only, lowercase filenames).
7. Launch the app again — it will load your game data and generate a `settings.ini`.

### Getting `Data.rsdk`
You **must** provide your own `Data.rsdk` from a legitimate copy of Sonic CD:
- **iOS:** [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sonic-cd-classic/id454316134) — extraction tutorial [here](https://gamebanana.com/tuts/14491)
- **Android:** [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sega.soniccd.classic) — extraction tutorial [here](https://gamebanana.com/tuts/14942)
- **Steam:** via [Sonic Origins](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1794960) or the original release

## Configuration
Edit `settings.ini` in the Files app to customize:
- `DataFile` — name of your `.rsdk` file
- `Language` — game language
- `DevMenu` — enable developer menu
- `BGMVolume` / `SFXVolume` — audio levels
- `DisableTouchControls` — toggle touch input

## Building from Source

### Requirements
- macOS with Xcode 16+ (or GitHub Actions)
- Git

### Clone
```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/RadiantDelux/RSDKv3-iOS.git
```

### Build
The project builds automatically via GitHub Actions. Push to the repo and the workflow will:
1. Build all dependencies (libogg, libvorbis, libtheora, SDL2) for iOS arm64
2. Compile the Xcode project
3. Generate an unsigned `.ipa` artifact

To trigger manually: go to **Actions** → **Build iOS IPA** → **Run workflow**.

### Manual Build
If building locally with Xcode:
1. Open `RSDKv3 ios.xcodeproj`
2. Set the scheme to **RSDKv3** and target **iOS Device (arm64)**
3. Build with `Release` configuration

> **Note:** You will need to apply the source patches from `.github/workflows/ios.yml` (the Setup step) before building locally, as they fix platform-specific incompatibilities.

## Disclaimer
This project does not include any copyrighted game assets. You must provide your own `Data.rsdk` file from a legitimate copy of Sonic CD. This is an engine reimplementation only.
